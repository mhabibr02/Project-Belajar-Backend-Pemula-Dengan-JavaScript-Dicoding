### Syllabus
#### 1. Backend Introduction <br>
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of back-end development, including how the back-end interacts with the front-end, the client-server model, and the role of APIs in modern
web applications.
#### 2. Fundamental Node JS <br>
In this section, learners will explore the basics of Node.js, including its architecture, asynchronous programming, modules, and file system interactions. It lays the groundwork for
using Node.js as a back-end runtime environment.
#### 3. Build Web Service with Node.js <br>
This module focuses on building RESTful web services using Node.js and the Hapi framework. It covers routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and structuring a back-end project.
#### 4. Deploy Web Services <br>
Students will learn how to deploy their web services to a production environment, specifically using Amazon EC2. This includes setting up servers, configuring environments, and making
services accessible online.
#### 6. Consuming and Testing RESTful APIs using Postman <br>
This final section teaches how to test and interact with RESTful APIs using Postman. Learners will validate endpoints, test various request methods, and ensure their services behave as
expected.

### Result
Upon completing this course, participants will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of back-end development.
- Create and structure RESTful APIs using Node.js and the Hapi framework.
